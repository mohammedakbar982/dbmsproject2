### 4. Analyze the queries
1)
```
SELECT time, latitude, longitude, place
FROM earthquakes_table
WHERE mag <= 4.0 AND type = 'earthquake' AND magType = 'md';
```

Here's a breakdown of what each part of the query does:

- `SELECT time, latitude, longitude, place` specifies the columns to be returned in the result set. In this case, we want the time, latitude, longitude, and place columns.
- `FROM earthquakes_table` specifies the table from which to retrieve the data. In this case, the table is named "earthquakes_table."
- `WHERE mag <= 4.0 AND type = 'earthquake' AND magType = 'md'` specifies the conditions that the rows must meet in order to be included in the result set. In this case, we want only earthquakes with a magnitude of 4.0 or less, a type of "earthquake," and a magnitude type of "md."

2)
```
SELECT 
    place, 
    mag, 
    time, 
    latitude, 
    longitiude, 
    SQRT(POWER(69.1 * (latitude - 45.3251), 2) + POWER(69.1 * (-69.8856 - longitiude) * COS(latitude / 55.7), 2)) AS distance,
    CASE 
        WHEN mag < 2 THEN 'Minor' 
        WHEN mag BETWEEN 2 AND 3.9 THEN 'Light' 
        WHEN mag BETWEEN 4 AND 5.9 THEN 'Moderate' 
        WHEN mag BETWEEN 6 AND 6.9 THEN 'Strong' 
        WHEN mag BETWEEN 7 AND 7.9 THEN 'Major' 
        ELSE 'Great' 
    END 
    
FROM earthquakes_table
ORDER BY distance DESC;
```

- `SELECT place, mag, time, latitude, longitiude,` specifies the columns to be returned in the result set. In this case, we want the place, magnitude, time, latitude, and longitude columns.
- `SQRT(POWER(69.1 * (latitude - 45.3251), 2) + POWER(69.1 * (-69.8856 - longitiude) * COS(latitude / 55.7), 2)) AS distance` calculates the distance between the earthquake's epicenter and a reference location (latitude 45.3251, longitude -69.8856) using the Haversine formula, which takes into account the curvature of the Earth. The distance is returned as a new column called "distance."
- `CASE WHEN mag < 2 THEN 'Minor' WHEN mag BETWEEN 2 AND 3.9 THEN 'Light' WHEN mag BETWEEN 4 AND 5.9 THEN 'Moderate' WHEN mag BETWEEN 6 AND 6.9 THEN 'Strong' WHEN mag BETWEEN 7 AND 7.9 THEN 'Major' ELSE 'Great' END` assigns a earthquake magnitude classification to each earthquake based on its magnitude, and returns it as a new column called "Mag_Classification."
- `FROM earthquakes_table` specifies the table from which to retrieve the data. In this case, the table is named "earthquakes_table."
- `ORDER BY distance DESC` sorts the results by the "distance" column in descending order.

```sql
SELECT place, COUNT(*) as num_earthquakes, AVG(mag) as avg_magnitude, 
       MAX(mag) as max_magnitude, MIN(mag) as min_magnitude
FROM earthquakes_table
WHERE time BETWEEN '2022-01-01' AND '2023-05-11'
GROUP BY place
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 10
ORDER BY num_earthquakes DESC, avg_magnitude DESC;
```

now

```
SELECT place, COUNT(*) as num_earthquakes, AVG(mag) as avg_magnitude, 
       MAX(mag) as max_magnitude, MIN(mag) as min_magnitude
```

- `SELECT place` specifies the column to be returned in the result set. In this case, we want the place column.
- `COUNT(*) as num_earthquakes` counts the number of earthquakes for each place and returns it as a new column called "num_earthquakes."
- `AVG(mag) as avg_magnitude` calculates the average magnitude of earthquakes for each place and returns it as a new column called "avg_magnitude."
- `MAX(mag) as max_magnitude` finds the maximum magnitude of earthquakes for each place and returns it as a new column called "max_magnitude."
- `MIN(mag) as min_magnitude` finds the minimum magnitude of earthquakes for each place and returns it as a new column called "min_magnitude."

```
FROM earthquakes_table
WHERE time BETWEEN '2022-01-01' AND '2023-05-11'
```

- `FROM earthquakes_table` specifies the table from which to retrieve the data. In this case, the table is named "earthquakes_table."
- `WHERE time BETWEEN '2022-01-01' AND '2023-05-11'` specifies the condition that the earthquakes must have occurred between January 1, 2022, and May 11, 2023, to be included in the result set.

```
GROUP BY place
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 10
```

- `GROUP BY place` groups the earthquakes by place.
- `HAVING COUNT(*) >= 10` specifies that only places where there have been at least 10 earthquakes during the specified time period should be included in the result set.

```
ORDER BY num_earthquakes DESC, avg_magnitude DESC;
```

- `ORDER BY num_earthquakes DESC, avg_magnitude DESC` sorts the results by the "num_earthquakes" column in descending order, and then by the "avg_magnitude" column in descending order.

4)
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as num_earthquakes, AVG(mag) as avg_magnitude, nst as nst
FROM earthquakes_table
WHERE place LIKE '%California%'
GROUP BY nst
ORDER BY nst ASC;
```

Here's a breakdown of what each part of the query does:

```
SELECT COUNT(*) as num_earthquakes, AVG(mag) as avg_magnitude, nst as nst
```

- `SELECT COUNT(*) as num_earthquakes` counts the number of earthquakes and returns it as a new column called "num_earthquakes."
- `AVG(mag) as avg_magnitude` calculates the average magnitude of earthquakes and returns it as a new column called "avg_magnitude."
- `nst as nst` specifies the "nst" column to be returned in the result set.

```
FROM earthquakes_table
WHERE place LIKE '%California%'
```

- `FROM earthquakes_table` specifies the table from which to retrieve the data. In this case, the table is named "earthquakes_table."
- `WHERE place LIKE '%California%'` specifies the condition that the "place" column must contain the string "California" to be included in the result set.

```
GROUP BY nst
ORDER BY nst ASC;
```

- `GROUP BY nst` groups the earthquakes by the "nst" value.
- `ORDER BY nst ASC` sorts the results by the "nst" value in ascending order.
